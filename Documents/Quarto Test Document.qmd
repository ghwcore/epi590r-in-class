## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

**MY TEST RUN ON QUARTO**

Running libraries. Going to hide using "echo."

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
```

Trying various outputs. Keeping it in window pane. Go to global setting \> R markdown to change setting to viewer pane.

```{r}

x <- 4
x

y <- 9
y
z <- 4*5
#|echo: false
#|z
```
